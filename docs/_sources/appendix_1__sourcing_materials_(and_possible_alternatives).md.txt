# Appendix 1: Sourcing materials (and possible alternatives)

## Solar cells

DEE uses reclaimed 6” square cells that are cut down into regular 1/8th size pieces prior to the workshop. This removes damaged sections of the cells and makes it easier to construct a panel of modest size with a sufficient charging voltage.

DEE can supply cells already cut to these sizes on request, but you can cut your own using a rotary tool (Dremel) with a fine diamond-tipped cutting disk. It works best if built into a jig to make a mini-table saw, that allows you to cut stacks of a dozen cells at a time. The cutting process creates a lot of dust, debris and noise, so goggles, ear protectors, and a dust mask are essential. Contact us if you'd like more details on how to do this.

DEE has 1kW boxes of undamaged 6” x 6” Grade A cells for sale, and can cut them into halves, quarters or eighths as required. Contact us at <info@dee.org.uk> with any requests.

You can also find cells of various sizes and specifications being sold on eBay, which can be useful for smaller projects.

## Polycarbonate

DEE uses 330mm x 265mm sheets of 4mm thick polycarbonate as the protective front of the solar panel. Polycarbonate is a tough, transparent plastic, that can be made UV resistant, meaning it can be left outside in sunlight for years without degrading. Polycarbonate usually comes in large sheets that will need to be cut to the size you want, but you can order polycarbonate pre-cut to a pre-determined size from a website such as <https://www.cutplasticsheeting.co.uk/clear-acrylic-sheeting/> if needed.

To cut polycarbonate, it's best to use a table saw, but a powerful jig saw or angle grinder with an appropriate blade or cutting disk will also do the job. As for any type of cutting work, goggles are essential.

When ordering polycarbonate, ensure that it's UV resistant. Other types of clear plastic such as acrylic or polystyrene are not UV resistant, meaning they will discolour if left in sunlight for too long, so are unsuitable for use in solar panels.

Glass can be used, but cutting it to the size for this design is difficult, and the EVA doesn't bind as firmly. For alternative designs for larger panels using reclaimed glass windows, see previous versions of DEE workshop guides.

## EVA

Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) is used to encapsulate the cells to make them weatherproof and to bind the cells to the polycarbonate sheet and into the neoprene case. It's used for the same purpose in commercially made panels. EVA comes in rolls as a translucent film, but when heated it becomes clear and transparent.

DEE uses EVA sheets cut from 1m wide rolls, that we can cut to whatever size is needed for our panels.

It's not the sort of thing that is commonly available to buy, but it is possible to find smaller quantities of solar EVA film on eBay.

You can also use a specialist two-part epoxy such as Qsil to encapsulate solar cells, but it wouldn't be suitable for this design. For alternative designs for larger panels using Qsil as an encapsulant, see previous versions of DEE workshop guides.

## Tabbing wire

Tabbing wire is thin, flat conductive wire that is coated in a layer of solder.

DEE has several long reels of 2mm tabbing wire that we use for our workshops, and we can supply it in various lengths.

Tabbing wire can be ordered on eBay and several other websites in large and small quantities.

## Flux pens

Flux is used to clean the surface of the metallic contacts of solar cells and to help the molten solder flow into the microscopic crevices of the material being soldered onto to create a strong bond.

DEE uses liquid flux, applied with refillable watercolour brush pens.

For small solar panel soldering jobs, you can can also use a disposable flux pen. These are readily available on ebay.

## DC converters

The DC voltage converter is used to step down the incoming voltage from the solar panel to a stable 5v voltage for a USB output.

The DC converters DEE use are enclosed buck converters that are reasonably cheap, efficient, sturdy and waterproof, but there are plenty of other options available that do a similar job. E.g. you could wire in a cigarette lighter socket and use a plug-in USB charger... this would allow you to use the solar panel to supply power to other 12V devices that use a cigarette lighter plug. You could also use an LM7805 voltage regulator, but it would need a decent heat sink to be used with a 12V supply for any length of time.

These are all readily available from eBay and other online shops.

## USB Battery packs

DEE recommends using a USB power bank with a solar charger to make best use of it. Having a power bank battery gives you the option to store energy that you can use to recharge your devices at night, instead of only using the solar power to charge devices directly when the sun is out.

One of the other workshops run by DEE shows how to make a USB power bank using lithium cells recovered from old laptop batteries. See [our workshops](https://www.demandenergyequality.org/our-workshops/) page for details.

In good direct sunlight, a 12W solar charger should be able to charge up a mobile phone or a 2000mAh battery pack in 2 hours. Bigger USB battery packs are available if you are looking for more storage.
