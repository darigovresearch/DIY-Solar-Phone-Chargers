<h2>The Demand Energy Equality project<a class="headerlink" href="#the-demand-energy-equality-project" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>Demand Energy Equality (DEE) is a UK based community energy project that seeks to provide practical energy education using solar photovoltaics. We are a group working for systemic change in the way energy is produced, distributed, controlled, delivered and used. These aims are within the context of rising energy inequality (in the UK, at least), rising fuel bills, climate change and the increasing cost of fossil fuel extraction. See <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">our</span> <span class="pre">website</span> <span class="pre">&lt;https://www.demandenergyequality.org/about/&gt;</span></code>_ to find out more about the project.</p>
<p>Through teaching people DIY solar PV skills we also aim to develop their relationship with energy, and enable them to understand it better: where it comes from, how it is used and how it relates to their demand and needs. Ultimately we aim for this to change behaviour, leading to better use of energy and overall reduced demand. Reduced energy use is an unavoidable fact of the relatively near future – far better to prepare now than be surprised later on.</p>

<h2>Using this guide<a class="headerlink" href="#using-this-guide" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>This written guide is for anyone interested in building their own solar phone charger, or learning more about the concepts involved. It assumes no prior knowledge of any kind relevant to building a fully functioning panel. The guide is designed to be used alongside other DIY guides and resources provided by DEE.</p>
<p>The guide starts with a summary of the tools and materials used. This is followed by a description of each of the steps in the process of building a portable 10W solar phone charger. At the end of the guide is an appendix with supplemental detailed information about the tools and materials needed.</p>
<p>For other types of DIY solar panel that can be made, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">instructables.com</span> <span class="pre">&lt;https://www.instructables.com/&gt;</span></code>_ is a good place to start looking for alternative designs. DEE (and other organisations) run workshops based on other panel designs – you will find information about the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">workshops</span> <span class="pre">&lt;https://www.demandenergyequality.org/our-workshops/&gt;</span></code>_ that we are currently running on the DEE website.</p>
<p>You will find the latest version of this guide available to download from the DEE website, as and when this guide is updated, alongside our <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">other</span> <span class="pre">guides</span> <span class="pre">and</span> <span class="pre">resources</span> <span class="pre">&lt;https://www.demandenergyequality.org/resources/&gt;</span></code>_.</p>
<p>We encourage you to share the skills you learn with others through your own workshops, particularly if you are able to target and work with low-income communities. Please contact us for any support you feel you may need if you plan to do this.</p>

<section id="the-design">
<h2>The design<a class="headerlink" href="#the-design" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h2>
<p>The basic components of the design, and that which makes it economically and practically feasible are the “broken” solar cells. These are cells produced in the industrial manufacture process (mainly in China) that are broken either in transit, or during assembly on arrival. Because they are of no commercial use, these cells can be bought relatively cheaply.</p>
<p>The solar charger this guide describes is a self-contained design, and can be connected directly to USB devices with no additional equipment needed.</p>
<p>This particular guide reflects the latest iteration in the construction of DIY photovoltaic panels as practiced by DEE, but it is likely that it may evolve and expand over time. Because we occasionally introduce new materials and construction methods, the guide may not always be in line with the other DIY resources published by DEE, and may not exactly reflect the content of current workshops. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Contact</span> <span class="pre">DEE</span> <span class="pre">&lt;https://www.demandenergyequality.org/contact-us&gt;</span></code>_ if you need an update on any recent changes.</p>
